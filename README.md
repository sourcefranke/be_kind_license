# Be Social License

This is my personal draft of a license, that can be used both for software and other forms of creative content.

Initially, I created this license to be used for the introduction of a presentation about FOSS licenses.
Then, well, after that I thought, let's use it for real and publish it - to allow anyone to use it, too.
